Place the contents of the GameData folder in your KSP/GameData folder:

Kerbal Space Program/GameData/DmagicUtilities/CapCom

CapCom has two required dependencies; Contract Parser and Progress Parser. Both are included in the download package and can be found in the same folder as CapCom. Both are also dependencies for Contracts Window + and should not be removed unless both of those addons are removed.
